      <description>The so-called Flynn&amp;rsquo;s taxonomy is proposed by Michael J. Flynn in his paper Very high-speed computing systems and Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness published in 1970s.[1]&#xA;It categorizes computer architectures based on single/multiple instruction and single/multiple data into 4 types: SISD(Single Instruction Single Data), MISD(Multiple Instruction Single Data), SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data), MIMD(Multiple Instruction Multiple Data). The 4 acronyms are easy to get by simple combinations, but the key here is to understand their concepts and applications.</description>
