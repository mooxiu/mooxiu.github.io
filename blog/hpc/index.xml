      <description>&lt;p&gt;The so-called Flynn&amp;rsquo;s taxonomy is proposed by Michael J. Flynn in his paper &lt;em&gt;Very high-speed computing systems&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Some Computer Organizations and Their Effectiveness&lt;/em&gt; published in 1970s.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It categorizes computer architectures based on single/multiple instruction and single/multiple data into 4 types: SISD(Single Instruction Single Data), MISD(Multiple Instruction Single Data), SIMD(Single Instruction Multiple Data), MIMD(Multiple Instruction Multiple Data). The 4 acronyms are easy to get by simple combinations, but the key here is to understand their concepts and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
